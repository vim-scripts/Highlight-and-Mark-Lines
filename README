Inspired from other scripters. Thanks.

This utility was created because of needs as others. My job requires log
mining. Sometimes I need to highlight specific lines and moving between 
them for comparison. Most of my colleagues use UltraEdit which has this
capability which made me to find a way to add this capability to Vim.

What does this utility do?
It highlights and marks the line under cursor. Then you'll be able to move
between these marks easily. Unfortunately it is just limited to 3 marks because of my lack of coding knowledge.

Step 1 - Just highlight and mark the line with CTRL+F2, CTRL+F3 or CTRL+F4. 
Step 2 - Then use F2, F3 and F4 to move between these marks. 
Step 3 - Use SHIFT+CTRL+F2, SHIFT+CTRL+F3 and SHIFT+CTRL+F4 to reset the related mark and highlight.
Step 4 - use cm in normal mode to reset all highlights and marks

It is that simple.
